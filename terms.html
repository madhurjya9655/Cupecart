        these Terms of Use and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable
        listing of product service for the particular Merchant, apart from the
        delivery fees for Delivery Services. Please note that we cannot control
        any amount that may be charged to Buyer by his/her bank related to our
        collection of the total amount, and we disclaim all liability in this
        regard.
      </p>

      <p>
        In connection with Buyer’s Order, he/she will be asked to provide
        customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit
        card information either to us or our third party payment processor.
        Buyer agrees to pay us for the Order placed by you on the Platform, in
        accordance with these Terms. Buyer hereby authorizes the collection of
        such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting
        the booking, either directly by us or indirectly, via a third party
        online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on
        the Platform. If Buyer is directed to our third-party payment processor,
        he/she may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that
        third party's service and that third party's personal information
        collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and
        privacy policy before using the Platform services. Once the Order is
        confirmed you will receive a confirmation email summarizing the
        confirmed booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final tax bill will be issued by the Merchant and PDP (if registered
        for tax purposes) to the Buyer along with the Order and CUPECART is
        merely collecting the payment on behalf of such Merchant and PDP. All
        applicable taxes and levies, the rates thereof and the manner of
        applicability of such taxes on the bill are being charged and determined
        by the Merchant and PDP. CUPECART holds no responsibility for the legal
        correctness/validity of the levy of such taxes. The sole responsibility
        for any legal issue arising on the taxes shall reside with the Merchant
        and the PDP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prices reflected on the Platform, including packaging or handling
        charges, are determined solely by the Merchant and are listed based on
        Merchant's information. Very rarely, prices may change at the time of
        placing Order due to Merchant changing the menu price without due
        intimation and such change of price are at the sole discretion of the
        Merchant attributing to various factors beyond control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> Disclaimer: </strong>
        Prices on any product(s) as reflected on the Platform may due to some
        technical issue, typographical error or product information supplied by
        Merchant be incorrectly reflected and in such an event Merchant may
        cancel Buyer’s Order(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Merchant shall be solely responsible for any warranty/guarantee of
        the goods or services sold to the Buyers and in no event shall be the
        responsibility of CUPECART.
      </p>

      <p>
        The transactions are bilateral between the Merchant and Buyer, and
        between Merchant/Buyer and PDP, therefore, CUPECART is not liable to
        charge or deposit any taxes applicable on such transactions.
